## 📨 Email 1: The Welcome (Immediate)
**Subject:** 🇿🇦 You’re on the list! (And your exclusive HR roadmap)

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Welcome to the inner circle of **HR CoPilot**.

You’re now officially on the priority list for South Africa’s first AI-powered HR platform built specifically for the LRA and BCEA landscape.

**Why this matters:**
Most SA founders spend R3,500+ an hour on labor consultants or use "Google Templates" that actually put their business at risk. We're ending that.

**While you wait, here is your "Compliance First Steps" Roadmap:**
1. **Audit your Contracts:** Ensure your "Notice Period" clauses match the BCEA minimums (1 week for 6 months, 2 weeks for 1 year, etc).
2. **POPIA Check:** Are you storing your employees' ID numbers in an encrypted environment?
3. **The Disciplinary Code:** Do you have one? If not, you’re unprotected at the CCMA.

We’ll be reaching out soon with a private link to audit your existing policies for free using our AI.

Stay compliant,
**The HR CoPilot Team**

## 📨 Email 2: The Reality Check (Day 2)
**Subject:** The R250k mistake most SA SMEs make...

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Did you know that the average CCMA settlement for "Unfair Dismissal" (often due to a simple procedural error) is equivalent to 3-6 months of a worker's salary?

For a small business, that’s not just a fine—it’s a crisis.

**The most common trap?** 
Thinking a "Standard Employment Contract" protects you. 

In South Africa, the **procedure** is as important as the **policy**. If your documents don't outline the exact disciplinary steps required by the LRA, you've already lost the case.

**HR CoPilot** doesn't just give you a template; it builds a legally-defensible workflow for your specific industry.

We have a few "Founder Legacy" spots left for our private launch. Keep an eye on your inbox.

Cheers,
**Bennie | Founder, HR CoPilot**
