# 🚀 HR CoPilot Marketing Strategy - PHASE 2 LIVE (Waitlist Build)
**Target Market:** South African SMEs, Founders, and Operational Managers.

---

## 🏗️ 1. Landing Page Optimization (The Squeeze)
**Goal:** Convert cold traffic into "Free Audit" leads.
- **Hook:** "Is your business one 'disgruntled employee' away from a CCMA nightmare?"
- **Offer:** Free AI Policy Audit (Lead Magnet).
- **CTA:** "Sign up for a Free Audit" instead of just "Get Started".

## 🔗 2. LinkedIn Organic Strategy (@social-strategist)
**Pillar 1: Educational (The LRA/BCEA Expert)**
- *Post Idea:* "3 Hidden Clauses that make local contracts illegal."
- *Key Takeaway:* Most owners copy-paste from Google, forgetting SA-specific sick leave rules.

**Pillar 2: Emotional (The CCMA Horror Story)**
- *Post Idea:* "A R250k fine for a missing signature." (Based on real case law).
- *CTA:* Don't let this be your business. HR CoPilot covers you for the price of a coffee.
