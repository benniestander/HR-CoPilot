## 🦈 4. Board of Advisors: Strategic Stress-Test
*Insights from Marcus (Venture Capitalist)*

> "The 'Alpha' in this business isn't the SME paying R1,499. It's the **HR Consultant** using the portal to manage 50 clients. By Month 12, your Agency Network becomes the 'Moat'. If you own the infrastructure that 100 consultants use to run their businesses, you are no longer a 'vendor'—you are the **Market Utility**. That is where the 10x exit logic comes from."

## 🚀 5. Chief of Staff Checklist to R32M
1.  **Defense of IP:** Maintain strict 2026/2027 legal currency (BCEA/CCMA updates) to keep the "Institutional" status.
2.  **Agency Growth:** Aggressively pursue "Multi-Client" agencies to drive high-margin transaction fees.
3.  **Horizontal Integration:** Deep-link with South African payroll providers (SimplePay, Sage) by Month 9 to reduce churn.
