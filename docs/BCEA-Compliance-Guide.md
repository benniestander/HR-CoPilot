# Is Your Small Business a Lawsuit Waiting to Happen? The 2026 SA HR Survival Guide

*Does the thought of a CCMA referral keep you up at night?*

If you’re a South African business owner, it should.

Losing a single "unfair dismissal" case can cost you **months of revenue**. And the worst part? Most owners get sued not for being "bad bosses," but for having **outdated paperwork**.

The **Basic Conditions of Employment Act (BCEA)** isn't just a suggestion. It's the law. And in 2026, the Department of Employment and Labour is cracking down harder than ever.

Here is exactly how to protect your business... without spending R50,000 on an HR consultant.

### 1. The "Contract" Trap
Most owners download a random template from Google. **Don’t do this.**

In South Africa, if your contract doesn't explicitly mention things like the *BCEA minimum leave cycles* or *notice periods for different lengths of service*, you are legally naked.

**The Fix:** Every employee must have a signed contract that is compliant with the latest 2026 amendments. If you haven't updated yours in 2 years, you're at risk.

### 2. The 45-Hour Myth
Think you can just make people work until the job is done? Think again.

The BCEA is strict: 
*   **45 hours per week** max.
*   **9 hours a day** (if working 5 days).
*   **Overtime** must be agreed upon in writing.

If you don't have a written overtime policy, an employee can refuse to work late—and there's *nothing* you can do about it.

### 3. The Secret to Legal Firing
There is no such thing as "firing" someone on the spot in SA. Even for theft. Even for not showing up.

You must follow **Substantive** and **Procedural** fairness.
*   **Substantive:** A real reason.
*   **Procedural:** A fair hearing.

Without a written **Disciplinary Code**, you've already lost the case at the CCMA.
